# Contribution Guide

We are so excited and thankful that you are interested in contributing to this project!
Should you decide to contribute to the YouVersion React Component Library,
we came up with a few guidelines to help make your experience pleasant and painless.


## How can I contribute?


### Reporting Bugs

Before reporting a bug, please check the [Issues List][issues] to see if it's already been reported.

If you believe you've found an issue that isn't covered in the issues list, please submit a new issue to this project's [Issues List][issues]. Here's some guidelines, inspired by the  [Atom](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#reporting-bugs) project, that can make things easier:

 * Use a clear and descriptive title for the issue to identify the problem.
 * Describe the exact steps which reproduce the problem in as many details as possible.
 * Provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps. Include links to files or GitHub projects, or copy/pasteable snippets, which you use in those examples.
 * Describe the behavior you observed after following the steps and point out what exactly is the problem with that behavior.
 * Include screenshots and animated GIFs. When words fail, images can fill in the gaps.


### Code Contributions and Pull/Merge Requests


#### Check our issues list.
We don't typically accept pull requests for anything that isn't in our list of issues. If you're looking for a place to get started, dive right on into those issues and find one that tickles your fancy. We have some special issue labels to help you get started:

  * *[Good First Issue](https://github.com/lifechurch/melos/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22)*: These are low-hanging fruit that we believe would be a great place to get your feet wet. We ask that you limit yourself to only one or two of these. We want to leave plenty of easy grabbing on the lower limbs for all the newbies to share.

  * *[Volunteer](https://github.com/lifechurch/melos/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue%20is%3Aopen%20label%3A%22volunteer%22%20)*: Issues marked as "Volunteer" are usually well-documented, and ready for a volunteer or contributor to handle without a lot of guidance.
